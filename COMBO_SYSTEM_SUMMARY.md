## 💰 Score Impact Examples

### Beginner Difficulty
**Without Combo**: 170 points  
**With 3x Combo**: 204 points (+20%)  
**With 5x Combo**: 255 points (+50%)  
**With 10x Combo**: 340 points (+100%)  

### Master Difficulty  
**Without Combo**: 1,250 points  
**With 10x Combo**: 2,500 points (+100%)  

## 🎯 Strategic Value

### Building Long Combos
- **Focus on Memory**: Learn card positions early
- **Avoid Guessing**: Random flips break combos
- **Plan Ahead**: Think before flipping
- **Risk Management**: Sometimes breaking combo is worth it for knowledge

### Combo vs. Other Systems
- **Synergy with Efficiency**: Both reward skillful play
- **Trade-off with Hints**: Hints don't break combos but cost points
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Higher difficulties allow longer combos

## ✨ Key Features
