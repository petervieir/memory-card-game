## 🧪 Testing Results

✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Passed with no errors  
✅ **Type Safety**: All type definitions correct  
✅ **Linter**: No errors introduced  
✅ **Build**: Ready for deployment  

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Start a Game**: Connect wallet and select difficulty
2. **View Hints**: Button shows available hints (e.g., "💡 Hint (3)")
3. **Use Hint**: Click button when you have ≥50 points
4. **Watch Reveal**: A matching pair flips for 3 seconds
5. **Continue Playing**: Cards flip back automatically, game resumes
6. **Track Usage**: Achievements reward efficient hint usage

## 💡 Strategic Considerations

### When to Use Hints
- Early game to learn the board layout
- When stuck after many failed attempts
- To preserve move efficiency for bonuses
- Strategic use on higher difficulties

### When to Avoid Hints
- Going for "No Hints Master" achievement
- Maintaining high point totals
- Practicing memory skills
- Challenge runs

## 🎯 Point Economy

| Action | Point Change | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Use Hint | -50 points | Reveals matching pair |
| Save 1 Move | +5 points | Efficiency bonus |
| Hint Break-Even | 10 moves saved | Hint worth it if saves 10+ moves |

## 🏆 Achievement Impact

**New Achievements**:
1. **No Hints Master**: Play perfectly without assistance
2. **Strategic Thinker**: Efficient use of single hint on hard mode

**Total Achievements**: 15 (previously 13)

## 📊 Statistics

- **Implementation Time**: ~2 hours
- **Files Modified**: 5
- **Files Created**: 3
- **New Code Lines**: ~150 lines
- **TypeScript Errors**: 0
- **Linter Errors**: 0

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Ideas)

While not implemented now, these could be added later:
- Different hint types (reveal one card, highlight area, etc.)
- Hint purchase with earned points
- Hint effectiveness analytics
- Leaderboards for low-hint completions
- Streak bonuses for consecutive no-hint games

## ✨ Key Features
