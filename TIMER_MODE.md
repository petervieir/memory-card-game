# Timer Mode Feature

## Overview
Timer Mode adds an optional time-based gameplay mode to the Memory Card Game, increasing replayability and challenge variety. Players can toggle between classic mode (no time limit) and timer mode (countdown timer with bonus points).

## Features Implemented

### 1. ‚è±Ô∏è Timer Countdown
- Dynamic timer based on difficulty level:
  - **Beginner**: 60 seconds
  - **Easy**: 90 seconds
  - **Medium**: 100 seconds
  - **Hard**: 110 seconds
  - **Expert**: 120 seconds
  - **Master**: 120 seconds
- Visual countdown display with color-coded progress bar
- Timer stops when game is complete or time runs out

### 2. üéØ Time Bonus Points
- Players earn **2 points per second** remaining when completing the game
- Time bonus is added before combo multiplier application
- Calculation: `(basePoints + efficiencyBonus + timeBonus) √ó comboMultiplier √ó difficultyMultiplier`
- Time bonus only applies when timer mode is enabled and game is completed before time runs out

### 3. üèÜ Time Attack Achievements
Five new achievements added in the "Time Attack" category:

| Achievement | Icon | Description | Condition |
|------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Time Attack Winner** | ‚è±Ô∏è | Complete a game in Timer Mode | Complete any game with timer enabled |
| **Speed Demon** | ‚ö° | Complete Timer Mode with 50%+ time remaining | Finish with at least half the time left |
| **Last Second Hero** | üò∞ | Complete Timer Mode with <10s remaining | Clutch victory in the final seconds |
| **Time Attack Master** | ‚è∞ | Complete Master difficulty in Timer Mode | Beat the hardest level against the clock |
| **Clock Beater** | üïê | Complete 10 games in Timer Mode | Long-term timer mode dedication |

### 4. üîÑ Classic/Timed Mode Toggle
- Easy-to-use toggle button in the difficulty selector screen
- Visual indication when timer mode is active (‚è±Ô∏è icon in game stats)
- Clear description of current mode
- Setting persists across sessions using Zustand persist middleware

### 5. üîä Timer Sound Effects
- **Warning Sound** (20s remaining): Alerts player time is running low
- **Critical Sound** (10s remaining): Urgent warning with toast notification
- **Time Up Sound**: Plays when timer reaches zero
- Sounds only play once per threshold to avoid repetition

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Time's Up Handling
- Game becomes unplayable when time runs out
- Cards are disabled (cannot be clicked)
- No points awarded for incomplete games
- Clear visual feedback showing "Time's Up" message
- Shows progress: how many pairs were completed out of total
- Auto-returns to difficulty selector after 3 seconds

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

#### `Timer.tsx`
Reusable timer component with:
- Countdown functionality
- Color-coded display (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí orange ‚Üí red)
- Progress bar visualization
- Callback support for tick and time-up events
- Time formatting (MM:SS)

### New Stores

#### `useTimerStore.ts`
Manages timer mode preference:
- Persisted setting using Zustand persist
- `timerEnabled`: boolean state
- `toggle_timer()`: Toggle timer mode on/off
- `enable_timer()`: Enable timer mode
- `disable_timer()`: Disable timer mode

### Updated Stores

#### `usePointsStore.ts`
- Added `timerModeGamesPlayed` counter
- Updated `incrementGamesPlayed()` to track timer mode games separately
- Modified achievement checking to handle "Clock Beater" achievement
- Added `time_attack` category support

#### `useDifficultyStore.ts`
No changes required - difficulty progression works the same for both modes.

### Updated Types

#### `game.ts`
Extended types to support timer mode:

```typescript
interface Difficulty {
  // ... existing fields
  timerSeconds: number; // Time limit for this difficulty
}

interface GameCompletionData {
  // ... existing fields
  timerMode: boolean; // Whether timer was enabled
  timeRemaining?: number; // Seconds left when completed
  totalTime?: number; // Total time available
}

type AchievementCategory = 'moves' | 'difficulty' | 'milestone' | 'special' | 'time_attack';
```

### Sound Effects

Added three new sound effect types:
- `timer_warning`: Plays at 20 seconds
- `timer_critical`: Plays at 10 seconds
- `time_up`: Plays when time expires

*Note: Currently using placeholder sounds (card-mismatch.mp3). Custom timer sounds can be added to `/public/sounds/` directory.*

## User Experience

### Difficulty Selector Screen
- Prominent timer mode toggle button with clear visual states
- Contextual description explaining current mode
- Orange highlight when timer mode is active
- Sound feedback on toggle

### During Gameplay
- Timer display in the top-right corner of game stats bar
- Color-coded timer (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí orange ‚Üí red)
- Progress bar showing time remaining visually
- "HURRY!" message appears when <10 seconds remain
- Timer icon (‚è±Ô∏è) shown in difficulty name when active

### Game Completion
#### Success (Timer Mode)
- Shows total points including time bonus breakdown
- Example: "Time Bonus: 40 pts (20s left)"
- All other bonuses (efficiency, combo) still apply

#### Time's Up
- Red-themed message box
- Clear "Time's Up!" heading
- Shows partial progress
- No points awarded
- Returns to selector after 3 seconds

## Points Calculation Example

**Scenario**: Medium difficulty, Timer Mode, completed in 35 moves with 25 seconds remaining, 5x combo

```
Base Points:         200
Efficiency Bonus:    +50  (45 - 35 = 10 moves √ó 5 points)
Time Bonus:          +50  (25 seconds √ó 2 points)
Subtotal:            300
Combo Multiplier:    √ó1.5 (5x combo)
After Combo:         450
Difficulty Mult:     √ó1.5 (Medium)
Final Score:         675 points
```

## Statistics Tracking

Timer mode games are tracked separately:
- Total games played (all modes)
- Timer mode games played (separate counter)
- Both tracked per wallet address
- Used for "Clock Beater" achievement

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Custom timer sounds (tick-tock, warning beeps, alarm)
2. Timer mode leaderboards
3. Speed run mode (minimize time instead of moves)
4. Time attack tournaments/events
5. Adjustable time limits (easy/medium/hard timer settings)
6. Time penalties for wrong matches
7. Time bonuses for perfect moves
8. Daily timer challenges
